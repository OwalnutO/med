# Motion Emotion Dataset(MED) 
Despite the huge research on crowd on behavior understanding in visual surveillance community, lack of publicly available realistic datasets for evaluating crowd behavioral interaction led not to have a fair common test bed for researchers to compare the strength of their methods in the real scenarios. This work presents a novel crowd dataset contains around 45,000 video clips which annotated by one of the five different fine-grained abnormal behavior categories.
We also evaluated two state-of-the-art methods on our dataset, showing that our dataset can be effectively used as a benchmark for fine-grained abnormality detection. The details of the dataset and the results of the baseline methods are presented in the paper.
